## Report a security issue

The Lucet project team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately via [Fastly’s security issue reporting process](https://www.fastly.com/security/report-security-issue). 

## Security advisories

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized. The project teams endeavors to coordinate remediation with third-party stakeholders, and is committed to transparency in the disclosure process. The Lucet team announces security issues via release notes as well as the [RustSec advisory database](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db) (i.e. `cargo-audit`) on a best-effort basis.

Note that communications related to security issues in Fastly-maintained OSS as described here are distinct from [Fastly Security Advisories](https://www.fastly.com/security-advisories).
