**Lucet is a native WebAssembly compiler and runtime. It is designed
to safely execute untrusted WebAssembly programs inside your application.**

Check out our [announcement post on the Fastly
blog](https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime).

Lucet uses, and is developed in collaboration with, Mozilla's
[Cranelift](http://github.com/cranestation/cranelift) code generator.

It powers Fastly's [Terrarium](https://wasm.fastlylabs.com) platform.

Lucet's documentation is available in the Wiki:
