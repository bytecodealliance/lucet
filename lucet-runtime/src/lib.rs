//! # Lucet Runtime for Sandboxed WebAssembly Applications
//!
//! This crate runs programs that were compiled with the `lucetc` WebAssembly to native code
//! compiler. It provides an interface for modules to be loaded from shared object files (see
//! `DlModule`), and for hosts to provide specialized functionality to guests (see
//! `Instance::embed_ctx()`).
//!
//! The runtime is a critical part of the safety and security story for Lucet. While the semantics
//! of WebAssembly and the `lucetc` compiler provide many guarantees, the runtime must be correct in
//! order for the assumptions of those guarantees to hold. For example, the runtime uses guard pages
//! to ensure that any attempts by guest programs to access memory past the end of the guest heap are
//! safely caught.
//!
//! The runtime is also extensible, and some of the key types are defined as traits for
//! flexibility. See the `lucet-runtime-internals` crate for details.
//!
//! ## Running a Lucet Program
//!
//! There are a few essential types for using the runtime:
//!
//! - [`Instance`](struct.Instance.html): a Lucet program, together with its dedicated memory and
//! signal handlers. Users of this API never own an `Instance` directly, but can own the
//! [`InstanceHandle`](struct.InstanceHandle.html) smart pointer.
//!
//! - [`Region`](trait.Region.html): the memory from which instances are created. This crate
//! includes [`MmapRegion`](struct.MmapRegion.html), an implementation backed by `mmap`.
//!
//! - [`Limits`](struct.Limits.html): upper bounds for the resources a Lucet instance may
//! consume. These may be larger or smaller than the limits described in the WebAssembly module
//! itself; the smaller limit is always enforced.
//!
//! - [`Module`](trait.Module.html): the read-only parts of a Lucet program, including its code and
//! initial heap configuration. This crate includes [`DlModule`](struct.DlModule.html), an
//! implementation backed by dynamic loading of shared objects.
//!
//! - [`Val`](enum.Val.html): an enum describing values in WebAssembly, used to provide
//! arguments. These can be created using `From` implementations of primitive types, for example
//! `5u64.into()` in the example below.
//!
//! - [`UntypedRetVal`](struct.UntypedRetVal.html): values returned from WebAssembly
//! functions. These must be interpreted at the correct type by the user via `From` implementations
//! or `retval.as_T()` methods, for example `u64::from(retval)` in the example below.
//!
//! To run a Lucet program, you start by creating a region, capable of backing a number of
//! instances. You then load a module and then create a new instance using the region and the
//! module. You can then run any of the functions that the Lucet program exports, retrieve return
//! values from those functions, and access the linear memory of the guest.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use lucet_runtime::{DlModule, Limits, MmapRegion, Region};
//!
//! let module = DlModule::load("/my/lucet/module.so").unwrap();
//! let region = MmapRegion::create(1, &Limits::default()).unwrap();
//! let mut inst = region.new_instance(module).unwrap();
//!
//! let retval = inst.run(b"factorial", &[5u64.into()]).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(u64::from(retval), 120u64);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Embedding With Hostcalls
//!
//! A "hostcall" is a function called by WebAssembly that is not defined in WebAssembly. Since
//! WebAssembly is such a minimal language, hostcalls are required for Lucet programs to do anything
//! interesting with the outside world. For example, in Fastly's [Terrarium
//! demo](https://wasm.fastly-labs.com/), hostcalls are provided for manipulating HTTP requests,
//! accessing a key/value store, etc.
//!
//! Some simple hostcalls can be implemented simply as an exported C function that takes an opaque
//! pointer argument (usually called `vmctx`). Hostcalls that require access to some underlying
//! state, such as the key/value store in Terrarium, can access a custom embedder context through
//! `vmctx`. For example, to make a `u32` available to hostcalls:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use lucet_runtime::{DlModule, Limits, MmapRegion, Region};
//! use lucet_runtime::vmctx::{Vmctx, lucet_vmctx};
//!
//! struct MyContext { x: u32 }
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! unsafe extern "C" fn foo(vmctx: *mut lucet_vmctx) {
//!     let mut vmctx = Vmctx::from_raw(vmctx);
//!     let hostcall_context = vmctx
//!         .get_embed_ctx_mut::<MyContext>();
//!     hostcall_context.x = 42;
//! }
//!
//! let module = DlModule::load("/my/lucet/module.so").unwrap();
//! let region = MmapRegion::create(1, &Limits::default()).unwrap();
//! let mut inst = region
//!     .new_instance(module)
//!     .unwrap();
//! inst.insert_embed_ctx(MyContext { x: 0 });
//!
//! inst.run(b"call_foo", &[]).unwrap();
//!
//! let context_after = inst.get_embed_ctx::<MyContext>().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(context_after.x, 42);
//! ```
//!
//! The embedder context is backed by a structure that can hold a single value of any type. Rust
//! embedders should add their own custom state type (like `MyContext` above) for any context they
//! require, rather than using a common type (such as the `u32`) from the standard library. This
//! avoids collisions between libraries, and allows for easy composition of embeddings.
//!
//! For C-based embedders, the type `*mut libc::c_void` is privileged as the only type that the C
//! API provides. The following example shows how a Rust embedder can initialize a C-compatible
//! context:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use lucet_runtime::{DlModule, Limits, MmapRegion, Region};
//!
//! let module = DlModule::load("/my/lucet/module.so").unwrap();
//! let region = MmapRegion::create(1, &Limits::default()).unwrap();
//! struct PretendLibcRuntime { _unused: u8 };
//! let mut libc = PretendLibcRuntime { _unused: 0 };
//! let mut inst = region
//!     .new_instance(module)
//!     .unwrap();
//! inst.insert_embed_ctx(libc);
//!
//! inst.run(b"main", &[]).unwrap();
//!
//! // clean up embedder context
//! drop(inst);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Custom Signal Handlers
//!
//! Since Lucet programs are run as native machine code, signals such as `SIGSEGV` and `SIGFPE` can
//! arise during execution. Rather than letting these signals bring down the entire process, the
//! Lucet runtime installs alternate signal handlers that limit the effects to just the instance
//! that raised the signal.
//!
//! By default, the signal handler sets the instance state to `State::Fault` and returns early from
//! the call to `Instance::run()`. You can, however, implement custom error recovery and logging
//! behavior by defining new signal handlers on a per-instance basis. For example, the following
//! signal handler increments a counter of signals it has seen before setting the fault state:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use lucet_runtime::{
//!     DlModule, Error, Instance, Limits, MmapRegion, Region, SignalBehavior, TrapCode
//! };
//! use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering, ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT};
//!
//! static SIGNAL_COUNT: AtomicUsize = ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT;
//!
//! fn signal_handler_count(
//!     _inst: &Instance,
//!     _trapcode: &TrapCode,
//!     _signum: libc::c_int,
//!     _siginfo_ptr: *const libc::siginfo_t,
//!     _ucontext_ptr: *const libc::c_void,
//! ) -> SignalBehavior {
//!     SIGNAL_COUNT.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
//!     SignalBehavior::Default
//! }
//!
//! let module = DlModule::load("/my/lucet/module.so").unwrap();
//! let region = MmapRegion::create(1, &Limits::default()).unwrap();
//! let mut inst = region.new_instance(module).unwrap();
//!
//! // install the handler
//! inst.set_signal_handler(signal_handler_count);
//!
//! match inst.run(b"raise_a_signal", &[]) {
//!     Err(Error::RuntimeFault(_)) => {
//!         println!("I've now handled {} signals!", SIGNAL_COUNT.load(Ordering::SeqCst));
//!     }
//!     res => panic!("unexpected result: {:?}", res),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When implementing custom signal handlers for the Lucet runtime, the usual caveats about signal
//! safety apply: see
//! [`signal-safety(7)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html).
//!
//! ## Interaction With Host Signal Handlers
//!
//! Great care must be taken if host application installs or otherwise modifies signal handlers
//! anywhere in the process. Lucet installs handlers for `SIGBUS`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGILL`, and `SIGSEGV`
//! when the first Lucet instance begins running, and restores the preÃ«xisting handlers when the
//! last Lucet instance terminates. During this time, other threads in the host process *must not*
//! modify those signal handlers, since signal handlers can only be installed on a process-wide
//! basis.
//!
//! Despite this limitation, Lucet is designed to compose with other signal handlers in the host
//! program. If one of the above signals is caught by the Lucet signal handler, but that thread is
//! not currently running a Lucet instance, the saved host signal handler is called. This means
//! that, for example, a `SIGSEGV` on a non-Lucet thread of a host program will still likely abort
//! the entire process.
