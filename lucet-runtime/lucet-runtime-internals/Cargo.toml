# This is only a dependency to ensure that other crates don't pick a newer version as a transitive
# dependency. `0.1.3 < getrandom <= 0.1.6` cause `lazy_static` to pull in spinlock implementations
# of concurrency primitives, which for unknown reasons cause our signal handling code to
# nondeterministically segfault. The maintainers have since removed the `lazy_static` dependency
# from `getrandom`, but until a new release is cut, this keeps it on a safe version.
