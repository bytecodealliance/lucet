/// The macro that surrounds definitions of Lucet hostcalls in Rust.
///
/// **Note:** this macro has been deprecated and replaced by the `#[lucet_hostcall]` attribute.
///
/// It is important to use this macro for hostcalls, rather than exporting them directly, as it
/// installs unwind protection that prevents panics from unwinding into the guest stack.
///
/// Since this is not a proc macro, the syntax is unfortunately fairly brittle. The functions it
/// encloses must be of the form:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[$attr1]
/// #[$attr2]
/// ... // any number of attributes are supported; in most cases you will want `#[no_mangle]`
/// pub unsafe extern "C" fn $name( // must be `pub unsafe extern "C"`
///     &mut $vmctx,
///     $arg1: $arg1_ty,
///     $arg2: $arg2_ty,
///     ... , // trailing comma must always be present
/// ) -> $ret_ty { // return type must always be present even if it is `()`
///     // body
/// }
/// ```
