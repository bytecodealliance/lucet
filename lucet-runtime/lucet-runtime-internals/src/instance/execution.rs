//! The `execution` module contains state for an instance's execution, and exposes functions
//! building that state into something appropriate for safe use externally.
//!
//! So far as state tracked in this module is concerned, there are two key items:
//! "execution domain" and "terminability".
//!
//! ## Execution Domain
//!
//! Execution domains allow us to distinguish what an appropriate mechanism to signal termination
//! is. This means that changing of an execution domain must be atomic - it would be an error to
//! read the current execution domain, continue with that domain to determine temination, and
//! simultaneously for execution to continue possibly into a different execution domain. For
//! example, beginning termination directly at the start of a hostcall, where sending `SIGALRM` may
//! be appropriate, while the domain switches to `Hostcall` and is no longer appropriate for
//! signalling, would be an error.
//!
//! ## Terminability
//!
//! This is used to answer the question "is it safe to initiate termination of this instance right
//! now?".  An instance is terminable when it is created or reset. An instance stops being
//! terminable when it is terminated, when it faults, or when it is dropped. When an instance
//! finishes running, it will once again be terminable, but existing [`KillSwitch`] objects will no
//! longer be valid.
//!
//! Termination does not directly map to the idea of guest code currently executing on a processor,
//! because termination can occur before the guest has started, during host code, or while a guest
//! has yielded execution.
//!
//! As a result, termination of a running instance can only be treated as a best-effort to
//! deschedule a guest. This is typically quick when it occurs during guest code execution, and
//! otherwise happens immediately upon resuming execution of guest code (exiting host code, or
//! resuming a yielded instance).
//!
//! ## Instance Lifecycle and `KillState`
//!
//! And now we can enumerate interleavings of execution and terminability, to see the expected
//! state at possible points of interest in an instance's lifecycle:
//!
//! * `Instance created`
//!   - terminable: `true`
//!   - execution_domain: `Pending`
//!   - termination result: `Ok(KillSuccess::Cancelled)`
//! * `Instance::run executing`
//!   - terminable: `true` or `false`
//!   - termination result: `Ok(KillSuccess::Signalled)`, `Ok(KillSuccess::Pending)`, or
//!     `Err(KillError::NotTerminable)`
//!   - execution_domain: `Guest, Hostcall, or Terminated`
//!   - `execution_domain` will only be `Guest` when executing guest code, only be `Hostcall` when
//!     executing a hostcall, but may also be `Terminated` while in a hostcall to indicate that it
//!     should exit when the hostcall completes.
//!   - `terminable` will be false if and only if `execution_domain` is `Terminated`.
//!   - `KillSwitch::terminate` will succeed with `Signalled` when terminated while executing guest
//!     code, `Pending` when terminated while executing a hostcall, and will fail with
//!     `NotTerminable` when the instance has already been terminated.
//! * `Instance::run returns`
//!   - terminable: `true`
//!   - execution_domain: `Pending, Hostcall, or Terminated`
//!   - termination result: `Err(KillError::Invalid)`
//!   - `execution_domain` will be `Pending` when the initial guest function returns, `Hostcall`
//!     when terminated by `lucet_hostcall_terminate!`, and `Terminated` when exiting due to a
//!     termination request.
//!   - While `terminable` *is* true, it should be noted that [`KillState`] is reset here, and
//!     existing `KillSwitch` objects will no longer hold a reference to the instance kill state.
//! * `Guest function executing`
//!   - terminable: `true`
//!   - termination result: `Ok(KillSuccess::Signalled)`
//!   - execution_domain: `Guest`
//! * `Hostcall called`
//!   - termination result: `Ok(KillSuccess::Pending)`
//!   - execution_domain: `Hostcall`
//! * `Hostcall executing`
//!   - termination result: `Ok(KillSuccess::Pending)` or `Err(KillError::NotTerminable)`
//!   - execution_domain: `Hostcall, or Terminated`
//!   - `execution_domain` will typically be `Hostcall`, but may be `Terminated` if termination of
//!     the instance is requested during the hostcall.
//!   - `KillSwitch::terminate` will return `NotTerminable` if and only if the instance has already
//!     been terminated.
//! * `Hostcall yields`, or `Hostcall resumes`
//!   - These are specific points in "Hostcall executing" and has no further semantics.
//! * `Hostcall returns`
//!   - termination result: `Ok(KillSuccess::Signalled)`
//!   - execution_domain: `Guest`
//!   - `execution_domain` may be `Terminated` before returning, in which case `terminate` will
//!     return `NotTerminable`, but the hostcall would then exit. If a hostcall successfully
//!     returns to its caller it was not terminated, so the only state an instance will have after
//!     returning from a hostcall will be that it is executing terminable guest code.
//! * `Guest faults`, `Hostcall faults`, `Guest returns`, `Instance::reset` or `Instance dropped`
//!   - termination result: `Err(KillError::Invalid)`
//!
//!   - If an instance is reset or finishes running (through fault or normal return), outstanding
//!   `KillSwitch` objects will no longer hold a valid reference to the instance. In that case,
//!   calls to `terminate` will return `Invalid`, and have no bearing on further execution.
//!
