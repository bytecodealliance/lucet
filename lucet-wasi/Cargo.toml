# `src/wasi_host.rs` is automatically generated using clang and
# wasi-libc headers. This requires these to be present, and installed
# at specific paths, which is not something we can rely on outside
# of our environment.
# So, we follow what most other tools using `bindgen` do, and provide
# a pre-generated version of the file, along with a way to update it.
# This is what the `update-bindings` feature do. It requires the WASI SDK
# to be either installed in `/opt/wasi-sdk`, or at a location defined by
# a `WASI_SDK` environment variable, as well as `clang` headers either
# being part of `WASI_SDK`, or found in a path defined by a
# `CLANG_ROOT` environment variable.
